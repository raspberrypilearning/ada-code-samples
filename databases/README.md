These resources support the Ada Computer Science database and SQL [topics](https://adacomputerscience.org/topics) and [questions](https://adacomputerscience.org/questions).

### Files

Each sample database contains a copy of the complete SQLite database with the extension `.sqlite` that you can download and run SQL statements against.

The `.txt` files contain the SQL statements for creating the tables and inserting the test data yourself. You would first need to create a new SQLite database in the database application of your choice.

More detailed PDF instructions are also provided, which include links to the relevant database and text files.

### Usage

The SQL statements are designed to be used with an SQLite database management system, such as DB Browser for SQLite https://sqlitebrowser.org or the browser based SQLite Online https://sqliteonline.com
