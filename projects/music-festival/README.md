The music festival, melody meadows, is one of the database scenarios used on the [Ada Computer Science](https://adacomputerscience.org/) platform.

The [scenario page](https://adacomputerscience.org/concepts/dbs_scenario_music_festival) contains information about the design of the database, sample data, and links to the related questions that use this scenario. There is also an instance of the database in the final "Try it now" section that uses the [Ada SQL Editor](https://adacomputerscience.org/support/student/code#sql-editor), allowing you to write and run SQL statements within the browser without any extensions or downloads. 

The music festival is also used within a larger [database project](https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/projdb_music_festival) with sections on analysis, design, implementation, testing and evaluation.

### Database structure

The database has two tables:

- `stage`
- `performance`

The test data contains over 30 performances scheduled for the festival.

### Files

`music_festival.sqlite` contains a copy of the SQLite database with the tables and test data included.

The `.txt` files contain the SQL statements for creating the tables and inserting the test data yourself:

- `music_festival_create_tables.txt` is for creating the two tables
- `music_festival_insert_all.txt` has the test data for the two tables

More detailed PDF instructions are also provided, which include links to the music festival database and text files.

### Usage

The SQL statements are designed to be used with an SQLite database management system, such as DB Browser for SQLite https://sqlitebrowser.org or the browser based SQLite Online https://sqliteonline.com
